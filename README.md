# Pytorch starter FasterRCNN Train
In this notebook I enabled the GPU and the Internet access (needed for the pre-trained weights). We can not use Internet during inference, so I'll create another notebook for commiting. Stay tuned!

You can find the [inference notebook here](https://github.com/Taha-Najafzadeh/pytorch-starter-fasterrcnn-train/blob/main/pytorch-starter-fasterrcnn-train.ipynb)

- FasterRCNN from torchvision
- Use Resnet50 backbone
- Albumentation enabled (simple flip for now)
